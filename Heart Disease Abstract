ABSTRACT:


Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart.The term “heart disease” is often used interchangeably with the term “cardiovascular disease”. Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke.Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world.According to a news article, heart disease proves to be the leading cause of death for both women and men. The article states the following 

About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year–that’s 1 in every 4 deaths.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than half of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in menThis makes heart disease a major concern to be dealt with. 

But it is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, and many other factors. Due to such constraints, scientists have turned towards modern approaches like Data Mining and Machine Learning for predicting the disease.

Machine learning (ML) proves to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry.

Heart Disease is one of the major concerns for society today.
It is difficult to manually determine the odds of getting heart disease based on risk factors. However, machine learning techniques are useful to predict the output from existing data.
